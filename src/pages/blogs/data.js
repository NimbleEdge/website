        content: `Our community website is officially LIVE! Everything started on September 1, 2021. And today we have a growing community of 300+ active members from various backgrounds, including hackers, developers, researchers, engineers, PhD students, professors, and more. You can be one too. Join our [Discord!](/discord).\n\nOur core mission is to raise awareness of edge computing and the benefits it offers in terms of privacy, security, and app performance. For this purpose, we host random jam sessions and live coding jams in our [Discord](/discord) community .\n\nBut it's time to step it up a notch! We've got some events planned for you to get involved in the community and grow together. Such as, monthly Edgy talks with industry leaders, engineers and researchers. We did our first **Edgy talk** on February 19th and will have our second one later this month!\n\nThat seems great, but are you someone who prefers hands-on learning? If so, get ready for the **CTF challenge** in April 2022. More information will be released soon!\n\nIn addition, we have **Paper-reading Sessions** hosted by prominent researchers and authors. If you're a student, you can also form a [**student club**](/start-a-club) if one doesn't already exist and get started! Plus, we're seeking volunteers to assist with documentation and tutorials, community events, contributing to projects, and more! Ping us on discord if interested!\n\nAnd there's more to comeâ€¦\nMost of all.\n\nJoin us for the Community Website Launch Party! On [Discord](/discord), from 8:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. IST on Tuesday, March 8th.\nWe hope to see you there!`
